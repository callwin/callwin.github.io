Once upon the time there was a network. The network was formless and empty, darkness  was over the network perimeter, over routers and switches, all over the nodes and end points. And network admins and engineers were hovering over editing running-configs with naked notepad.exe and felt no shame slow to scale the infrastructure so programmers can deploy code and user can run applications. 

And programmers said "Let there be API, so we can manage the network infrastructure like code." They created some code. And they let code gather in one place. And they called called that  place GitHub.

Now Python was more crafty than any of the languages under the sky. And programmers said let Python rule over APIs and let it automate network nodes.

Network engineers and admins saw that APIs were good for good and pleasing for the managers. They took some of it and learned some Python. And eyes of them were opened, and they realized they were naked. So they cloned some code from GitHub and put it together.

And now they realized that they condemned to write code, commit to GitHub, run Linux commands, Ansible and containers.
